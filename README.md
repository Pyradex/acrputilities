# üìò ACRP Utilities (Slash-Only)

Clean, minimal, **3-file** Discord bot that delivers:

- **Ticket System**
  - Assistance channel **dropdown only** (no embed text)
  - Tickets created under **Your Tickets** category (by **ID**)
  - Staff **claim via dropdown** (NO buttons)
  - Logs to a channel as **clean embeds**
  - Logs include **who opened**, **who claimed/responded**, **which dropdown was clicked**, **transcript**
  - Transcript captured on close and **attached** as `.txt`

- **Team Message Request & Approval**
  - `/requestmsg heading:<text> message:<text> team:<role>`
  - Sends to private **Approval** channel (CCR/SCR only)
  - **Approve/Decline** via dropdown; on approve, bot **broadcasts** to the channel where the command was run

- **Moderation (Slash)**
  - `/ban`, `/kick`, `/warn`, `/timeout`, `/untimeout`, `/mute`, `/unmute`
  - All punishments: **embed in channel** + **DM to user** + **log embed**

- **Session System**
  - `/session vote/start/shutdown/low/full` ‚Üí posts embeds to **SESSION_CHANNEL_ID**
  - Vote uses dropdown (Yes/No/Abstain) with live tallies

- **Minimal Deploy**
  - No `.env` file; use **Render.com** environment variables
  - Keep-alive via a tiny web server (for UptimeRobot pings)
  - Single code file: `index.js`
